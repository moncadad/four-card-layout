### What I learned

Learned how to integrate bootstrap, sass styling and react together. I figured out how to make use of code better.
Notibly decreased code compare to what it would have been if I coded it without the use of frameworks or libraries.

What really helped me when building this project was taking a moment to breakdown the whole design when it came to repeated patterns.
For example the cards all had the same structure the difference was the actual content displayed. Same thing could be observed when it came to the styling.

I attempted to build the layout with a grid, in this case flexbox worked best to give it a fluid look.

```html /jsx
I utilized props alongside an object that held the data for each cards. For the
card component I used one I found in bootstrap.
```

```css/ sass
  For styling I used sass I enjoy the fact that it a bit of a structure.
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning react, I belive its a powerful tool. I'd also like to understand more in depth. I feel like I know enough to get me by when it comes to front end, but hey why not try for better.

Design is also a big one, I feel like overall there's only so many, but I love design so I'm sure it be something easy to grasp. I'll probably look more into it. I guess only time will tell!
